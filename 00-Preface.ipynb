    "My journey to TypeScript was not a direct or quick one. I started off in school\n",
    "primarily writing Java, then C++, and like many new developers raised on statically\n",
    "typed languages, I looked down on JavaScript as “just” the sloppy little scripting\n",
    "language people throw onto websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first substantial project in the language was a silly remake of the original Super\n",
    "*Mario Bros*. video game in pure HTML5/CSS/JavaScript and, typical of many first\n",
    "projects, was an absolute mess. In the beginning of the project I instinctively disliked\n",
    "JavaScript’s weird flexibility and lack of guardrails. It was only toward the end that I\n",
    "really began to respect JavaScript’s features and quirks: its flexibility as a language, its\n",
    "ability to mix and match small functions, and its ability to just work in user browsers\n",
    "within seconds of page load.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time I finished that first project, I had fallen in love with JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Static analysis (tools that analyze your code without running it) such as TypeScript\n",
    "also gave me a queasy gut feeling at first. *JavaScript is so breezy and fluid*, I thought,\n",
    "*why bog ourselves down with rigid structures and types*? Were we reverting back to the\n",
    "worlds of Java and C++ that I had left behind?\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back to my old projects, it took me all of 10 minutes of struggling to read\n",
    "through my old, convoluted JavaScript code to understand how messy things could\n",
    "get without static analysis. The act of cleaning that code up showed me all the places\n",
    "I would have benefited from some structure. From that point on, I was hooked onto\n",
    "adding as much static analysis to my projects as I could.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s been nearly a decade since I first tinkered with TypeScript, and I enjoy it as much\n",
    "as ever. The language is still evolving with new features and is more useful than ever\n",
    "in providing safety and structure to JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope that by reading *Learning TypeScript* you can learn to appreciate TypeScript the\n",
    "way I do: not just as a means to find bugs and typos—and certainly not a substantial\n",

    "\n",
    "If you have an understanding of writing JavaScript code, can run basic commands in\n",

    "* The history and context for why TypeScript is useful on top of “vanilla” JavaScript\n",

    "* Articulate the benefits of TypeScript and general characteristics of its type system.\n",
    "* Add type annotations where useful in your code.\n",

    "## Why I Wrote This Book\n",
    "\n",
    "TypeScript is a wildly popular language in both industry and open source:\n",
    "\n",
    "* GitHub’s 2021 and 2020 State of the Octoverses have it at the platform’s fourth top language, up from seventh in 2019 and 2018 and tenth in 2017.\n",
    "* StackOverflow’s 2021 Developer Survey has it at the world’s third most loved language (72.73% of users).\n",
    "* The 2020 State of JS Survey shows TypeScript has consistently high satisfaction and usage amounts as both a build tool and variant of JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "For frontend developers, TypeScript is well supported in all major UI libraries and\n",
    "frameworks, including Angular, which strongly recommends TypeScript, as well as\n",
    "Gatsby, Next.js, React, Svelte, and Vue. For backend developers, TypeScript generates\n",
    "JavaScript that runs natively in Node.js; Deno, a similar runtime by Node’s creator,\n",
    "emphasizes directly supporting TypeScript files.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite this plethora of popular project support, I was rather disappointed\n",
    "by the lack of good introductory content online when I first learned the language.\n",
    "Many of the online documentation sources didn’t do a great job of explaining what a\n",
    "“type system” is or how to use it. They often assumed a great deal of prior knowledge\n",
    "in both JavaScript and strongly typed languages, or were written with only cursory\n",
    "code examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not seeing an O’Reilly book with a cute animal cover introducing TypeScript years\n",
    "ago was a disappointment. While other books on TypeScript from publishers includ‐\n",
    "ing O’Reilly now exist prior to this one, I couldn’t find a book that focuses on the\n",
    "foundations of the language quite the way I wanted: why it works the way it does and\n",
    "how its core features work together. A book that starts with a foundational explana‐\n",
    "tion of the language before adding on features one-by-one. I’m thrilled to be able to\n",
    "make a clear, comprehensive introduction to TypeScript language fundamentals for\n",
    "readers who aren’t already familiar with its principles."

    "* Part III, “Usage”: Now that you understand the features that make up the TypeScript language, how to use them in real-world situations to improve your code reading and editing experience.\n",
