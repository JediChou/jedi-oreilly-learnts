    "Reading that code without any context, you can only have vague ideas on how to call\n",
    "the paintPainting function. Perhaps if you’ve worked in the surrounding codebase\n",
    "you may recall that painter should be what’s returned by some getPainter function.\n",
    "You might even make a lucky guess that painting is a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if those assumptions are correct, though, later changes to the code may invalid‐\n",
    "ate them. Perhaps painting is changed from a string to some other data type, or\n",
    "maybe one or more of the painter’s methods are renamed.\n",

    "Other languages might refuse to let you run code if their compiler determines it\n",
